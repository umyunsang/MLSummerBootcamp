# üåü MLSummerBootcamp

Welcome to the **MLSummerBootcamp** repository! This repository is your go-to resource for both practical code exercises and theoretical notes from the summer bootcamp focused on Machine Learning (ML). Explore the materials below to enhance your ML skills.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **üìê [numpy/](./numpy_basic)**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory holds examples and exercises on using `NumPy`, a core library for numerical computations in Python. These examples are foundational for efficient array operations in ML.  
  *Note directory:* [NumPy Notes](./Notes/NumPy)

- **üìà [matplotlib/](./matplotlib)**  
  *Practical Code:* In this folder, you'll find scripts demonstrating how to visualize data using the `matplotlib` library. Data visualization is key to gaining insights from data.  
  *Note directory:* [matplotlib Notes](./Notes/Matplotlib)

- **üìä [Pandas/](./Pandas)**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory contains Python scripts (`.py` files) that focus on data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. Mastering Pandas is crucial for any data-related tasks in ML.  
  *Note directory:* [Pandas Notes](./Notes/Pandas)

- **ü§ñ [sklearn/](./sklearn)**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory includes scripts that demonstrate how to use `scikit-learn` to implement various machine learning algorithms. Learn how to build, train, and evaluate models using this powerful library.  
  *Note directory:* [scikit-learn Notes](./Notes/Sklearn)

- **üîó [LangChain/](./rag_practice)**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory focuses on overcoming the limitations of current LLMs by developing an enhanced version of ChatGPT using In-Context Learning. The scripts leverage LangChain to implement the RAG (Reinforcement Augmented Generation) method, enabling LLMs to learn from PDF files and produce outputs based on that learning.

  *Note directory:* [RAG Practice Notes](./Notes/LangChain)


## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umyunsang/MLSummerBootcamp.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to Desired Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MLSummerBootcamp/Pandas
   ```
   Replace `Pandas` with any other directory name to explore different topics.

3. **Run the Python Scripts**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Then, execute the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
