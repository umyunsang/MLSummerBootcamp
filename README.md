# 🌟 MLSummerBootcamp

Welcome to the **MLSummerBootcamp** repository! This repository is your go-to resource for both practical code exercises and theoretical notes from the summer bootcamp focused on Machine Learning (ML). Explore the materials below to enhance your ML skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **📊 [Pandas/](./Pandas)**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory contains Python scripts (`.py` files) that focus on data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. Mastering Pandas is crucial for any data-related tasks in ML.  
  *Related Theory:* [Pandas Notes](./Notes/Pandas)

- **📈 matplotlib/**  
  *Practical Code:* In this folder, you'll find scripts demonstrating how to visualize data using the `matplotlib` library. Data visualization is key to gaining insights from data.  
  *Related Theory:* [matplotlib Notes](./Notes/matplotlib.md)

- **📐 numpy_basic/**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory holds examples and exercises on using `NumPy`, a core library for numerical computations in Python. These examples are foundational for efficient array operations in ML.  
  *Related Theory:* [NumPy Notes](./Notes/NumPy.md)

- **📝 quiz/**  
  *Practical Code:* The `quiz` folder includes coding exercises and quizzes designed to reinforce your understanding of the topics covered throughout the bootcamp. Test your knowledge here!  
  *Related Theory:* [Quiz Notes](./Notes/Quiz.md)

- **🔍 rag_practice/**  
  *Practical Code:* This folder's purpose is currently unspecified, but it may contain practice scripts or exercises on a specific ML topic.  
  *Related Theory:* [RAG Practice Notes](./Notes/RAG_Practice.md)

- **🤖 sklearn/**  
  *Practical Code:* This directory includes scripts that demonstrate how to use `scikit-learn` to implement various machine learning algorithms. Learn how to build, train, and evaluate models using this powerful library.  
  *Related Theory:* [scikit-learn Notes](./Notes/sklearn.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLSummerBootcamp.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to Desired Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MLSummerBootcamp/Pandas
   ```
   Replace `Pandas` with any other directory name to explore different topics.

3. **Run the Python Scripts**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Then, execute the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
